Figured out that they were caeser and ascii and coded them but don't know how to test if it is right. |

And then I... |
| Aug 28-29 |   11:30-1   | Realized I literally just left shift as I go through the 8 digit binary numbers and then convert them to ascii after, so I figured out how to do #3.<br/> For #4 I looked at your lecture notes which were really helpful and realized that I just needed to determine a shift between the Hex value for A and the ascii value for A which would allow me to determine how to shift every value. <br/> Also did some documentation at the end before submitting. |
